Disease Classification with BERT

This project uses a pre-trained BERT model to classify diseases based on patient symptom descriptions.

Project Summary

Predicts diseases like flu, diabetes, heart disease, etc.

Works with text (symptoms) and other patient info (age, gender, temperature, etc.)

Uses BERT from Hugging Face Transformers

Tools Used

Python

Pandas, Scikit-learn

Transformers (Hugging Face)

PyTorch

Jupyter Notebook

Features

End-to-end classification pipeline

Handles text and structured data

Easy to adapt and scale

Future Improvements

Add real clinical data

Use domain-specific models like BioBERT

Deploy as a web API
